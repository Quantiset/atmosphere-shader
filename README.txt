Welcome to our Godot Atmosphere Shader!

To run the program, you must install Godot, a Video Game Engine. You can easily install this for free on Steam.

Once you clone the repository to your local computer, open the repository folder in Godot. This will take you the Godot UI for a 3D Program.

To build the program itself, simply click the "play" button on the top-right of the screen. This will then load the planet + atmosphere.

If you want to mess any of the follow values:
	Planet Position
	Planet Radius
	Atmosphere Radius
	Sun Position
	Camera Position
	Camera Basis
	Scattering Coeff
	Color
In the Godot UI (program not application), Click on the MeshInstance3D. You should now be in the Inspector Tab (right side of the screen).
Click on the Black Plane where it says "Mesh", then Click on the Black Sphere where it "Material". You can then manually change each value for 
the variable above.
